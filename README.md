A game made by Me (Gavan) and Sebastian at Hackclub Daydream Seattle!

We worked on this over the course of 2 days (12 hours each day)

Multiple types of enemies (goomber, charger, turret)  
Lots of cute custom models and animations (thanks sebastian)  
Goomber is very nice (trust)  
A lot of code (yippee)
